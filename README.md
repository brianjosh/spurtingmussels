# spurtingmussels
This repository contains the data and code necessary to replicate the analyses described in 'Fishing for hosts: larval spurting by the endangered thick-shelled river mussel, Unio crassus' (Aldridge DC, Brian JI, Cmiel A, Lipinska A, Lopes-Lima M, Sousa R, Teixeira A, Zajac K, Zajac T). All correspondance should be directed to the corresponding author, DC Aldridge (d.aldridge@zoo.cam.ac.uk). 

The R script ('Aldridge_et_al_script.R') contains all the analyses specified in the methods, with the corresponding data files in .csv format. The entire spurting sequence of a focal mussel (mussel 'AL3', see Fig. 1c in the paper) is also attached (.xlsx).
